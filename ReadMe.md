## About the project

The intent of this project is to create a graphics library and game engine that I can use for other projects of mine and to get a better understanding in how game engines are built.

## Project goals

* Modular and split in concrete blocks of functionality.
* Keep it simple to use. Every part of the code should be relatively self-explanatory.
* Allow room for expansion to console systems. Getting it to run on a PS Vita would be really cool.
* Performance, performance, performance.
